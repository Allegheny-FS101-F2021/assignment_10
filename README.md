### Work File
You are to place your text in the File, `writing/techAndPolicy.md`. Your work must be submitted on GitHub. Please do not submit your work via email or send shared documents.

#### Overview
During this course, we have been talking about how a technology, or interpretation of data, had been designed to address and (hopefully) to resolve a particular task. Our discussion continued towards the use and potential misuses of the technology or data. During our conversation, we uncovered many cases where misuse was an actual reality. This effort inspired several writing assignments where you wrote meaningfully about the types of damages and unintended consequences that could result from misuse of technology or incorrect/inappropriate analysis/application of data.

Finally, in our semester-long conversation, we settled on the topic of regulation and policy (i.e., a system of rules) as it relates to technology and data, privacy, and potential misuses of technology. Throughout this work, your writing involved using published articles from the literature to help form evidence of your insights and to provide an established foundation for your work.

In this assignment, you are required to write an essay of about 2000 words, about four (4) pages where you name some new type of technology that you have not yet written about. In your essay, you are to discuss some of the uses and misuses of the technology (or application of data), and then to focus on some resulting policy which was created in response to the misuse. In your discussion of the policy you are to explain what concerns prompted the policy and then to cover some of its elemental parts. The policy could be something that resulted from a governmental or a legal action or something that was enacted by a specific company or organization. In addition, you are to have five (5) primary source articles in your bibliography to support your insights and to form a foundation of your work.


#### Flow of Writing

The flow of your work should take the following general form. Please use references to back up any factual information you provide or any claims you make.

  - **SECTION CONCERNING: YOUR TAKE ON THE TECHNOLOGY WITH THE POLICY**
   - Why are you interested in the tech and the policy?

### Special Note: Informed Consent

Our section of FS 101 has been asked by the FS Leadership Team (FSLT) to participate in its assessment plan. As part of this project, Dr. Bonham-Carter will be submitting samples of student work to the FSLT for analysis. Student names will be removed from all materials. All student work will then be anonymous, and individual students will not be identifiable to the readers.

Participation in this assessment plan will have no impact on studentsâ€™ course grades. If you do not want your work to be included for this study, please inform your professor. If you have any questions about this assessment plan, you may also contact the coordinator of the project, Dr. Jennifer Dearden.

## GitHub and Markdown

 - First, please familiarize yourself with GitHub. For example, [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) provides a good reference guide. If you require more help, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
